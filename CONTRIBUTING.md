### Contributing Code

#### Workflow

1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run check              # TypeScript check
   npm test                   # Run unit tests
   npm run test:coverage      # Generate coverage report
   npm run build              # Build verification
   ```
   
   **Required Testing Standards:**
   - All new features must include tests
   - Maintain minimum 75% code coverage for critical paths
   - Tests must pass locally before pushing
   - Run accessibility checks for UI changes (see below)

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "type: brief description"
   ```
   
   **Commit message format**:
   - `feat: Add guest mode browsing`
   - `fix: Resolve Stripe.js loading issue`
   - `docs: Update installation instructions`
   - `style: Format code with prettier`
   - `refactor: Simplify authentication logic`
   - `test: Add tests for payment flow`
   - `chore: Update dependencies`

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to the original repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Link related issues
   - Submit for review

#### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for type safety
- **Formatting**: Code is formatted automatically (if configured)
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names
  - Components: PascalCase (`UserProfile.tsx`)
  - Functions: camelCase (`getUserData`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
- **Comments**: Use JSDoc for public APIs
- **Imports**: Organize and group imports logically

#### Testing Standards

All contributions must meet these testing requirements:

**Unit Tests**
- Write tests for all new functions and components
- Use descriptive test names: `it('should display error when login fails with invalid credentials')`
- Mock external dependencies (Supabase, APIs)
- Aim for 75%+ code coverage

**Integration Tests**
- Test user flows end-to-end for critical features
- Use realistic test data
- Test happy path and error scenarios

**E2E Tests** (for major features)
- Add E2E tests for new authentication flows
- Update `test/e2e/` with new scenarios
- Follow existing test patterns in `auth-flow.test.ts`

**Coverage Requirements**
- **Critical paths**: 75% minimum coverage
- **New features**: Must include tests before merge
- **Bug fixes**: Add regression tests

**Running Tests Locally**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# View coverage report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# Run E2E tests (when implemented)
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Accessibility (A11y) Standards

All UI changes must meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** accessibility standards:

**Before Submitting UI Changes:**
1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All interactive elements accessible via Tab
   - Enter/Space keys activate buttons
   - Logical tab order
   - Visible focus indicators (contrast ratio ≥ 3:1)

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Use semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`)
   - Add `aria-label` for icon-only buttons
   - Use `aria-live` for dynamic content
   - Test with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac)

3. **Color & Contrast**
   - Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (normal text)
   - Large text contrast ≥ 3:1 (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold)
   - Don't rely on color alone to convey information
   - Use [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

4. **Form Accessibility**
   - Labels associated with inputs (`htmlFor` + `id`)
   - Error messages clearly indicated
   - Required fields marked with `aria-required`
   - Validation errors announced to screen readers

5. **Images & Media**
   - All images have descriptive `alt` text
   - Decorative images use `alt=""`
   - Videos have captions/transcripts (if applicable)

**Testing Tools:**
- Browser DevTools (Lighthouse Accessibility score)
- [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) browser extension
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
- Screen readers: NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (Mac)

**Audit Documents:**
- Review [BUTTON_A11Y_AUDIT.md](./BUTTON_A11Y_AUDIT.md) for button components
- Check [MEDIA_TEST_PLAYBOOK.md](./MEDIA_TEST_PLAYBOOK.md) for media features
- Follow WCAG guidelines in audit checklists

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Overview

Zyeuté V3 uses **Vitest** for unit and integration tests, with scaffolding for **E2E tests** (Playwright/Cypress to be implemented).

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Run tests in watch mode (during development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with UI (interactive)
npm run test:ui

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Structure

```
client/src/
├── test/
│   ├── e2e/              # End-to-end tests (scaffolded)
│   │   ├── auth.e2e.test.ts
│   │   ├── guestMode.e2e.test.ts
│   │   └── loginFlow.e2e.test.ts
│   └── setup.ts          # Test configuration
├── components/
│   └── Button.test.tsx   # Component tests
├── hooks/
│   └── useGuestMode.test.ts  # Hook tests
└── pages/
    └── __tests__/
        └── PasswordManagement.test.tsx
```

### Writing Tests

#### Component Tests

```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import Button from './Button';

describe('Button Component', () => {
  it('renders with text', () => {
    render(<Button>Click Me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Click Me')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('handles click events', () => {
    const handleClick = vi.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>);
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Click Me'));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();
  });
});
```

#### Unit Tests

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { validateEmail } from './validation';

describe('Email Validation', () => {
  it('accepts valid email', () => {
    expect(validateEmail('test@example.com')).toBe(true);
  });

  it('rejects invalid email', () => {
    expect(validateEmail('invalid')).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

#### E2E Tests (Scaffolded - Phase 2)

E2E tests are currently scaffolded and will be implemented in Phase 2:

```typescript
// client/src/test/e2e/auth.e2e.test.ts
describe('Authentication E2E Tests', () => {
  it('should successfully login with valid credentials', async () => {
    // To be implemented with Playwright/Cypress
    // 1. Navigate to /login
    // 2. Enter credentials
    // 3. Click submit
    // 4. Verify redirect to home
  });
});
```

See [auth.e2e.test.ts](client/src/test/e2e/auth.e2e.test.ts) for complete test plans.

### Test Requirements for PRs

When submitting a Pull Request:

#### ✅ Required
- Add tests for new features
- Update tests for modified functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Maintain or improve code coverage

#### 🎯 Coverage Goals
- **Overall:** 80%+ code coverage
- **Critical paths:** 95%+ (auth, payments, etc.)
- **New code:** 100% coverage for new files

#### 📝 Test Checklist

- [ ] Unit tests for new functions/utilities
- [ ] Component tests for new React components
- [ ] Integration tests for new API endpoints
- [ ] Update existing tests if behavior changed
- [ ] All tests pass locally (`npm test`)
- [ ] Coverage meets requirements (`npm run test:coverage`)

### Testing Best Practices

#### DO ✅
- Write tests before fixing bugs (TDD)
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests isolated and independent
- Mock external dependencies (API, database)
- Test user interactions, not implementation details

#### DON'T ❌
- Skip tests because "it's too simple"
- Test implementation details (CSS classes, internal state)
- Write tests that depend on other tests
- Use real API calls in tests
- Commit failing tests
- Ignore test failures in CI/CD

### Debugging Tests

```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test -- Button.test.tsx

# Run tests matching pattern
npm test -- --grep "login"

# Run in debug mode
npm test -- --inspect-brk

# Use Vitest UI for visual debugging
npm run test:ui
```

### CI/CD Integration

Tests run automatically on:
- **Every push** to PR branches
- **Every PR** to `main` or `develop`
- **Before deployment** to production

GitHub Actions workflows:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Test suite
- `.github/workflows/lighthouse-ci.yml` - Performance tests
