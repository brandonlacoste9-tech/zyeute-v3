## 🗓️ Customization Guidance

**If your team has different priorities:**

```
Option 1: Run phases in different order
- Current: 1 (CI/CD) → 2 (Types) → 3 (Performance) → 4 (Studio)
- Alternative: 3 (Performance) first → then 1 → then 2 → then 4
- Just re-prioritize GitHub Project board

Option 2: Adjust phase scope
- All details are in COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_2025.md
- Can scale down (skip non-critical items)
- Can scale up (add features not listed)

Option 3: Extend timeline
- Currently: 12 weeks (2-3 person team at 40 hrs/week)
- Can stretch to: 16-20 weeks (1-2 person team at 25 hrs/week)
- Adjust velocity in weekly status template

Option 4: Adjust team structure
- Phase 1: 1-2 developers
- Phase 2: 1 developer (parallel with Phase 3 planning)
- Phase 3: 1-2 developers
- Phase 4: 2+ developers
```
